# wedding invitation digital card
I wanted to have a digital wedding invitation card for my wedding and this repo came to life.

# It's time to upgrade this project
After applied the first version of this project to my own wedding.
I decided to spend more time adding more features into this project.
This second version will be used by my friend's wedding.
